# ExperimentalReactors
This mod adds a variety of "Reactor Unlockers", which when placed next to the part of it's respective reactor unlocks a ton of new settings for you to play around with, such as disabling explosions from said reactors or tuning their specific settings. For the survival players, there is also a craftable diagnostic tool to see more hidden stats of the reactor you click on.
## Progress
I just began making this mod and I'm not even sure if it's possible to make, but I intend to add most of the features I stated above.
